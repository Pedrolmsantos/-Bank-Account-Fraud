# Bank-Account-Fraud
In a large consumer bank, individuals can apply online for a bank account opening and, if granted, benefit from the banking services. Leveraging this system, fraudsters attempt to gain access to such services by identity theft or by creating a fictional individual. Once access to a new bank account is granted, the fraudster quickly takes advantage of the accompanying line of credit or uses the account to receive illicit payments. In this scenario, where the fraudster succeeds, the bank sustains all costs as there is no way of tracing the fraudster's true identity.

Using a dataset gathered from online bank account opening applications, this project aims to provide informed and well-documented advice on which predictive modelling solution to use to detect fraudulent applications accurately.
